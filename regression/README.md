## Regression

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (developed using Google Colab) as part of my studies in Machine Learning fundamentals, focusing on regression techniques and statistical analysis.

### Topics covered

* Correlation analysis
* Simple linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Polynomial regression and overfitting analysis

The notebook includes data exploration, visualization, mathematical formulation of regression models, and practical experiments using Python and common scientific libraries.

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand how regression models work internally, interpret their results, and analyze their limitations when applied to real datasets.

This work was developed for academic purposes and reflects my learning process throughout the course.
