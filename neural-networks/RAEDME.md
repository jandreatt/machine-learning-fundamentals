## Deep Learning

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook developed as part of my studies in Deep Learning, focusing on the analysis and understanding of neural network models.

### Topics covered
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Model architecture analysis
- Activation functions
- Optimization and regularization techniques
- Hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of epochs
- Training and evaluation behavior

### What is explored
Rather than implementing models from scratch, the notebook focuses on:
- Line-by-line code interpretation
- Explanation of each layer and operation
- Analysis of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Discussion of optimization strategies and their impact on performance
- Descriptive evaluation of model results

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to consolidate theoretical and practical understanding of neural networks by analyzing an existing implementation, identifying design choices, and evaluating how different components contribute to model performance and generalization.

This work was developed for academic purposes and reflects my learning process in deep learning concepts.
