## Classification

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of my studies in Machine Learning fundamentals, focusing on supervised classification techniques.

### Topics covered
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

The projects explore both the theoretical foundations and practical behavior of classification algorithms, including distance-based, probabilistic, linear, and margin-based models.

### What is explored
- Algorithm implementation and usage
- Impact of hyperparameters (such as *k* in kNN)
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Model evaluation using accuracy
- Data visualization to support analysis and interpretation

### Purpose
The goal of these notebooks is to build a solid understanding of how different classification models work, how they compare to each other, and how data preprocessing choices affect performance.

These projects were developed for academic purposes and reflect my learning process throughout the course.
